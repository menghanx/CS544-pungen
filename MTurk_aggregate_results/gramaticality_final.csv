And others might not catch that a word was either misspelled OR misused: principle and principal are often used interchangeably, even though that's wrong.  Seems like it would be hard to interpret the results.  Right for the wrong reasons vs right for the right reasons, etc.Also, I thought the instructions were a little unclear where you said:""Please give a comparative score to each sentence. 5 indicates very grammatical, 1 indicates not grammatical. You can give sentences the same score if they are equally grammatical/ungrammatical, but please try your best to distinguish them.​""Did you mean that you wanted the least grammatical of each group given a 1, and the most grammatical given a 5?  Were we supposed to use each rating once per group, if we could?  You said ""comparative scores,"" but was that within a group, or across all groups, or what?"
